# Customer Segmentation:
I analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics
information for the general population. I use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, I use demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company.
